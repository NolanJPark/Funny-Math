Ever wanted to do basic math with integers greater than or that can become greater than 2,147,483,647? Well now you can with these java codes.

copied codes from BlueJ to Github, addition and subtraction could use refinment but work but multiplication and division are still works in progress, and I'm thinking about doing two things:
  1. adding comments so my code is more comprehensible
  2. adding a check function which'll make sure the user can't input non-integers
